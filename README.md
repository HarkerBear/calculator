# Background:
I made this calculator demo in 2016 when I firstly touched programming.
This is my first demo, which is totally based on Html, CSS and JavaScript.
I haven't shared this tiny demo with others, I hope you will like it.

# Wanna Check it out!
Here are 2 very easy steps:
1. Download the whole file on your local computer.
